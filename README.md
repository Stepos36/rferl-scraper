## About 
_A web application that lets users view and leave comments on the latest news from <a href="https://www.rferl.org/">RadioLiberty</a> news website_

## Description
Once you load the main page, you'll see the page with a __table__ on it:

* **Column 1:** 

...This column contains a **plus button**. Once you click this button, the program will go to <a href="https://www.rferl.org/">RadioLiberty</a>
website, collect all text for this particular article and populate it into multiple _child rows(each paragraph of text has its' own row)_.
If you click the plus button once again, child rows will collapse back and bring you to initial page view.

* **Column 2:** 

...Second column holds __article title__, __short article text summary__ and a __view notes button__.
All that information comes from MongoDB and is populated from it every time you visit '/' route. 

* **Column 3:** 

...This column holds the estimate time you'll spend reading this article. It's __calculated__ based on the average amount of symbols per word(~4.79), average adult reading speed(~240wpm) and amount of symbols in this article.

* **Column 4:**

...Fourth column contains the publication date of this article

* **Column 4:**
